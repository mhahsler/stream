\title{Balanced Iterative Reducing Clustering using Hierarchies}
\usage{
DSC_BIRCH(threshold, branching, maxLeaf, maxMem = 0, outlierThreshold = 0.25)
}
\arguments{
\item{threshold}{threshold used to check whether a new datapoint can be absorbed or not}

\item{branching}{branching factor (maximum amount of child nodes for a nonleaf node) of the CF-Tree.}

\item{maxLeaf}{maximum number of entries within a leaf node}

\item{outlierThreshold}{threshold for identifying outliers when rebuilding the CF-Tree}

\item{maxMem}{memory limitation for the whole CFTree in bytes. Default is 0, indicating no memory restriction.}
}
\description{
BIRCH builds a balanced-tree of Clustering Features (CFs) to summarize the stream.
A CF is a tuple (n, LS, SS) which represents a cluster by storing the number of elements (n), their linear sum (LS) and their squared sum (SS).
Each new observation descends the tree by following its closest CF until a leaf node is reached.
It is either merged into its closest leaf-CF or inserted as a new one.
All leaf-CFs form the micro-clusters. Rebuilding the tree is realized by inserting all leaf-CF nodes into a new tree structure with an increased threshold.
}
\examples{
stream <- DSD_Gaussians(k = 3, d = 2)

BIRCH <- DSC_BIRCH(threshold = .1, branching = 8, maxLeaf = 20)
update(BIRCH, stream, n = 500)

plot(BIRCH,stream)
