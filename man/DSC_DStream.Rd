\arguments{
\item{formula}{\code{NULL} to use all features in the stream or a model \link{formula} of the form \code{~ X1 + X2}
to specify the features used for clustering. Only \code{.}, \code{+} and \code{-} are currently
supported in the formula.}

\item{gridsize}{Size of grid cells.}

\item{lambda}{Fading constant used function to calculate the decay factor
\eqn{2^-lambda}.  (Note: in the paper the authors use lamba to denote the
decay factor and not the fading constant!)}

\item{gaptime}{sporadic grids are removed every gaptime number of points.}

\item{Cm}{density threshold used to detect dense grids as a proportion of
the average expected density (Cm > 1). The average density is given by the
total weight of the clustering over \eqn{N}, the number of grid cells.}

\item{Cl}{density threshold to detect sporadic grids (0 > Cl > Cm).
Transitional grids have a density between Cl and Cm.}

\item{attraction}{compute and store information about the attraction between
adjacent grids. If \code{TRUE} then attraction is used to create
macro-clusters, otherwise macro-clusters are created by merging adjacent
dense grids.}

\item{epsilon}{overlap parameter for attraction as a proportion of
\code{gridsize}.}

\item{Cm2}{threshold on attraction to join two dense grid cells (as a
proportion on the average expected attraction).  In the original algorithm
\code{Cm2} is equal to \code{Cm}.}

\item{k}{alternative to Cm2 (not in the original algorithm).  Create k
clusters based on attraction. In case of more than k unconnected components,
closer groups of MCs are joined.}

\item{N}{Fix the number of grid cells used for the calculation of the
density thresholds with Cl and Cm. If \code{N} is not given (0) then the
algorithm tries to determine N from the data. Note that this means that N
potentially increases over time and outliers might produce an extremely
large value which will lead to a sudden creation of too many dense
micro-clusters. The original paper assumed that N is known a priori.}

\item{x}{DSC_DStream object to get attraction values from.}

\item{relative}{calculates relative attraction (normalized by the cluster
weight).}

\item{grid_type}{the attraction between what grid types should be returned?}

\item{dist}{make attraction symmetric and transform into a distance.}

\item{dsd}{a \link{DSD} data stream object.}

\item{n}{number of plots taken from \code{dsd} to plot.}

\item{type}{Plot micro clusters (\code{type = "micro"}), macro clusters (\code{type = "macro"}),
both micro and macro clusters (\code{type = "both"}), outliers(\code{type = "outliers"}),
or everything together (\code{type = "all"}). \code{type = "auto"} leaves to the class of DSC to decide.}

\item{grid}{logical; show the D-Stream grid instead of circles for micro-clusters.}

\item{assignment}{logical; show assignment area of micro-clusters.}

\item{...}{further argument are passed on.}

\value{

\description{
Micro Clusterer with reclustering.
Implements the grid-based D-Stream data stream clustering algorithm.
}
\details{
D-Stream creates an equally spaced grid and estimates the density in each
grid cell using the count of points falling in the cells. Grid cells are
classified based on density into dense, transitional and sporadic cells.
The density is faded after every new point by a factor of \eqn{2^{-lambda}}.
Every gaptime number of points sporadic grid cells are removed.

For reclustering D-Stream (2007 version) merges adjacent dense grids to form
macro-clusters and then assigns adjacent transitional grids to
macro-clusters. This behavior is implemented as \code{attraction = FALSE}.

The 2009 version of the algorithm adds the concept of attraction between
grids cells. If \code{attraction = TRUE} is used then the algorithm produces
macro-clusters based on attraction between dense adjacent grids (uses
\code{Cm2} which in the original algorithm is equal to \code{Cm}).

For many functions (e.g., \code{\link[=get_centers]{get_centers()}}, \code{\link[=plot]{plot()}}), D-Stream
adds a parameter \code{grid_type} with possible values of \code{"dense"},
\code{"transitional"}, \code{"sparse"}, \code{"all"} and \code{"used"}. This
only returns the selected type of grid cells. \code{"used"} includes dense
and adjacent transitional cells which are used in D-Stream for reclustering.
For \code{plot()} D-Stream also provides extra parameters \code{"grid"} and
\code{"grid_type"} to show micro-clusters as grid cells (density represented
by gray values).

\code{DSOutlier_DStream} classifies points that do not fall into a dense grid cell as
outlier/noise.

Note that \code{DSC_DStream} can at this point not be saved to disk using
save() or saveRDS(). This functionality will be added later!

\examples{
stream <- DSD_BarsAndGaussians(noise = .05)
plot(stream)

dstream1 <- DSC_DStream(gridsize = 1, Cm = 1.5)
update(dstream1, stream, 1000)
dstream1

# micro-clusters (these are "used" grid cells)
nclusters(dstream1)
head(get_centers(dstream1))

# plot (DStream provides additional grid visualization)
plot(dstream1, stream)
plot(dstream1, stream, grid = TRUE)

# look only at dense grids
nclusters(dstream1, grid_type = "dense")
plot(dstream1, stream, grid = TRUE, grid_type = "dense")

# look at transitional and sparse cells
plot(dstream1, stream, grid = TRUE, grid_type = "transitional")
plot(dstream1, stream, grid = TRUE, grid_type = "sparse")

### Macro-clusters
# standard D-Stream uses reachability
nclusters(dstream1, type = "macro")
get_centers(dstream1, type = "macro")
plot(dstream1, stream, type = "macro")
evaluate_static(dstream1, stream, measure = "crand", type = "macro")

# use attraction for reclustering
dstream2 <- DSC_DStream(gridsize = 1, attraction = TRUE, Cm = 1.5)
update(dstream2, stream, 1000)
dstream2

plot(dstream2, stream, grid = TRUE)
evaluate_static(dstream2, stream, measure = "crand", type = "macro")
